# Mobile Automator — Scenario Synthesizer (aware mode)

> **Note:** The recording feature is experimental and in active development per issue #21. It is gated behind `MOBILE_AUTOMATOR_RECORDER=1`. If you are being invoked, the user has explicitly opted in — proceed with the synthesis task as described.

## Overview
This skill is invoked at the **end** of a `/mobile-automator:record` session. The companion sidecar process has already streamed device events, taken hierarchy snapshots, and saved screenshots into a structured artifact bundle on disk. **Your job is synthesis, not capture** — you do NOT replay the scenario, do NOT call mobile-mcp tools, and do NOT prompt the user for new steps. You read the bundle, reconcile user edits, and emit a final scenario JSON that conforms to the same schema as scenarios produced by `/mobile-automator:generate`.

You inherit the rules of the generator skill by reference. **Do not re-decide assertion taxonomy, auto-assertion behavior, or schema field shapes** — those live in `.gemini/skills/mobile-automator-generator/SKILL.md` as the single source of truth.

## Persona: Mobile QA Synthesizer
- **Faithful to the recording:** Translate exactly what the sidecar captured — no extra steps, no inferred user intent beyond what events express.
- **Edit-aware:** The user may have renamed steps, deleted events, reordered, or annotated assertions during the recording session. Apply edits in chronological order before reasoning about the effective event list.
- **Schema-driven:** Every emitted scenario must validate against the v2.0 schema. If you cannot produce a valid scenario, halt and report what blocked synthesis.

## Inputs — Artifact Bundle Layout

The sidecar writes a bundle to `mobile-automator/.recorder/<scenario_id>/` with the following structure:

```
mobile-automator/.recorder/<scenario_id>/
├── metadata.json              # session metadata (scenario_id, started_at, device, app_package, environment)
├── events.jsonl               # one JSON object per line: device-side action events
├── edits.jsonl                # one JSON object per line: user edits applied during recording
├── assertions.json            # array of user-added assertions (may be empty in current scope)
├── hierarchy/
│   ├── 0000001234.json        # padded-millis filename; element hierarchy snapshot at that timestamp
│   ├── 0000002468.json
│   └── ...
└── screenshots/
    ├── step_<event_seq>.png   # one screenshot per recorded event
    └── ...
```

**Read order:**
1. `metadata.json` first — gives you `scenario_id`, `app_version`, `environment`, `started_at`, `app_package`, recording mode.
2. `events.jsonl` — primary timeline; each line is `{seq, timestamp_ms, kind, target_hint, value?, screenshot_ref, hierarchy_ref, ...}`.
3. `edits.jsonl` — user mutations: `{seq, timestamp_ms, op: "rename" | "delete" | "reorder" | "annotate", target_seq, payload}`.
4. `assertions.json` — array of assertion objects already typed by the user. **In the current scope this array may be empty**; handle the empty case gracefully and emit a scenario with no assertions if so.

If any required file is **missing or unreadable**, HALT and report which file is missing. Do not attempt to synthesize a partial scenario.

## Process

Apply these steps in order. Most rules referenced here are defined in the generator skill — do not redefine them.

1. **Load metadata.** Read `metadata.json` and use it to populate the scenario's top-level metadata block (`app_version`, `environment`). Do NOT include `device_model`, `api_level`, or `timestamp` in scenario metadata — those belong in result reports, not scenarios.

2. **Reconcile edits.** Read `events.jsonl` and `edits.jsonl` into memory. Apply edits in `timestamp_ms` order to derive the **effective event list**:
   - `rename` → update the target event's `display_name`.
   - `delete` → remove the target event from the effective list.
   - `reorder` → move the target event to its new position.
   - `annotate` → attach the annotation payload to the target event for later use in `expected_state`.

3. **Resolve element identity.** For each effective event, locate the hierarchy snapshot in `hierarchy/` whose padded-millis filename is the **most recent** at or before the event's `timestamp_ms`. Use `target_hint` from the event plus this snapshot to confirm the element. If the event's `display_name` is missing or marked `is_unnamed: true`, use AI vision over the event's screenshot (referenced by `screenshot_ref`) to suggest a concise descriptive name (e.g., "Login button", "Email input"). Never invent a target that has no evidence in the hierarchy snapshot.

4. **Map events to schema actions.** For each effective event, use the **Step Translation Guide** in `.gemini/skills/mobile-automator-generator/SKILL.md` to map the event `kind` to a schema action type (`tap`, `type`, `swipe`, `press_button`, `launch_app`, `open_url`, `long_press`, `double_tap`, `scroll_to_element`, `clear_app_data`, etc.). Do not invent action types — only emit values that appear in the generator skill's translation guide.

5. **Generate step IDs.** For each step, derive a snake_case `step_id` from `<action>_<short_target>` (e.g., `tap_login`, `type_email`, `swipe_carousel_left`). Ensure IDs are unique within the scenario; if a collision occurs, suffix with `_2`, `_3`, etc.

6. **Insert loading waits.** Between any two consecutive effective events, scan the hierarchy snapshots that fall in the gap. If snapshots in that interval contain elements whose class or text matches `{{loading_indicators}}` continuously for ≥300ms, insert a `wait_for_loading_complete` step before the second event. This mirrors the generator skill's loading-wait policy — see Section "Detecting and Encoding Patterns" in the generator skill for the canonical rule.

7. **Apply auto-assertion rule.** After every state-changing action (`tap`, `type` on submit-style inputs, `press_button`), automatically emit a `visual_state: "loaded"` or `element_exists` assertion for the resulting screen, marked `[auto-generated]` in its `description`. The full rule lives in the generator skill at Section "Auto-Assertion Rule" — do not re-derive it here.

8. **Ingest user assertions (if any).** If `assertions.json` is non-empty, append each entry as an assertion in the scenario, anchoring it via `after_step` to the step that immediately preceded it in the recording timeline. Validate that the assertion's `type` is one of the 27 documented assertion types (see Section "Assertion Type Decision Table" in the generator skill). Discard malformed entries and report them. If `assertions.json` is empty, emit an empty `assertions` array — this is a valid scenario.

9. **Generate tags.** Produce 1–5 kebab-case tags by intersecting `{{business_critical_paths}}` with the action verbs in the recording and the screen titles observed in hierarchy snapshots. Each tag MUST match the regex `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$` and be ≤20 characters. Discard any candidate that fails validation. If you cannot produce at least one valid tag, emit `"tags": []` — that is acceptable.

10. **Generate description.** One-line synthesis of the recording in ≤120 characters. Mention the entry screen, the primary action, and the resulting screen (e.g., `"Login flow from launcher to home dashboard for authenticated user"`).

11. **Emit the scenario JSON.** Always include `"$schema_version": "2.0"` as the first field. Use named string IDs (snake_case) for all steps and assertions; reference steps by name in `after_step`, never by integer. Validate the assembled JSON against `.gemini/skills/mobile-automator-generator/references/scenario_schema.json`. Write the result to `mobile-automator/scenarios/<scenario_id>.json`. If schema validation fails, HALT and report the validation errors — do not write a malformed file.

12. **Move screenshots.** Copy or move the per-step screenshots from `mobile-automator/.recorder/<scenario_id>/screenshots/` into `mobile-automator/screenshots/<scenario_id>/`, renaming each to match the synthesized step IDs (`step_<step_id>.png`).

13. **Cleanup on success.** Once the scenario JSON has been written AND schema validation has passed AND screenshots have been moved, delete the bundle at `mobile-automator/.recorder/<scenario_id>/`. This is the `cleanupOnSuccess` semantic — only delete after a successful synthesis. If any prior step failed or halted, **leave the bundle in place** so the user can retry or inspect the artifacts.

14. **Print summary.** Use the same shape as `/mobile-automator:generate`'s success message:
    > "✅ Scenario saved: `mobile-automator/scenarios/<scenario_id>.json`
    > - Steps: [N] | Checkpoints: [N] screenshots | Assertions: [N] | Tags: [tag1, tag2]
    > - Screenshots: `mobile-automator/screenshots/<scenario_id>/`"

## Cross-references — Single Source of Truth

The following rules are inherited from the generator skill — **do not duplicate or re-decide** them in this skill:

- **Two-pass action/assertion classification** — see `.gemini/skills/mobile-automator-generator/SKILL.md` Section "How to parse — Two-Pass Semantic Intent Model" (Pass 1 — Action vs. Assertion Classification; Pass 2 — Assertion Type Selection).
- **Step Translation Guide** — see `.gemini/skills/mobile-automator-generator/SKILL.md` Section "Step Translation Guide" for the canonical event-kind → schema-action mapping.
- **Auto-Assertion Rule** — see `.gemini/skills/mobile-automator-generator/SKILL.md` Section "Auto-Assertion Rule".
- **Assertion Type Decision Table (27 types)** — see `.gemini/skills/mobile-automator-generator/SKILL.md` Section "Assertion Type Decision Table".
- **Detecting and Encoding Patterns** (loading waits, optional steps, conditional steps, retry policy, capture variables, dynamic targets, nested sub-flows) — see `.gemini/skills/mobile-automator-generator/SKILL.md` Section "Detecting and Encoding Patterns".
- **Schema emission conventions** (named string IDs, `after_step` references, `$schema_version` placement, metadata field policy) — see `.gemini/skills/mobile-automator-generator/SKILL.md` Section "Save Scenario".

When a recorded event is ambiguous between an action and an assertion (rare — the recorder normally tags assertions explicitly), defer to the generator skill's classification rule: *"Does the user want the AI to DO something, or VERIFY something?"*

## Tag and Description Rules

- **Tags:** 1–5 kebab-case tags. Each tag MUST match `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$` and be ≤20 characters. Total tags ≤5. Drop invalid candidates silently.
- **Description:** One line, ≤120 characters. Synthesize from the recording's entry screen + primary user action + terminal screen.

## Operational Boundaries

### 🟢 DO
- Read every artifact in the bundle before emitting anything.
- Apply edits in chronological order to derive the effective event list.
- Cross-reference the generator skill for every rule whose canonical home is there.
- Validate the emitted JSON against `.gemini/skills/mobile-automator-generator/references/scenario_schema.json` before writing it.
- Move screenshots to `mobile-automator/screenshots/<scenario_id>/` matching the synthesized step IDs.
- Delete the bundle at `mobile-automator/.recorder/<scenario_id>/` only after schema validation succeeds.
- Handle an empty `assertions.json` by emitting an empty `assertions` array.

### 🔴 DON'T
- Replay any step on the device — synthesis is offline; do not call mobile-mcp tools.
- Add steps that have no corresponding event in the effective event list.
- Modify app source code in {{protected_directories}}.
- Re-state rules that already live in the generator skill — link to them instead.
- Delete the recorder bundle if synthesis halted or schema validation failed; leave it for retry.
- Invent assertion types outside the 27 documented in the generator skill's decision table.
